## 1. üß≠ Navigation & Focus

- Use **D-pad navigation** with clear visual focus states (borders, scaling, or shadows).
- **Focus Requirements:**
  - Focus indicators must be **at least 4dp thick** and use high contrast colors
  - Focused items should **scale up by 10-15%** or use a distinct border/glow
  - Focus should be **immediately visible** without animation delays
- Avoid ambiguous focus: ensure **only one item is focusable at a time**.
- Use a **predictable and spatial layout**: left/right and up/down movement should map naturally to UI arrangement.
- **Navigation Patterns:**
  - Support **circular navigation** in grids and lists where appropriate
  - Implement **fast scrolling** for long lists (hold direction for acceleration)
  - Use **focus memory** - return to previously focused item when navigating back
- **Remote Control Support:**
  - Primary: D-pad, Select, Back, Home, Menu
  - Secondary: Play/Pause, Fast Forward, Rewind (for media apps)
  - Optional: Voice search integration when available
- Avoid gesture-based navigation (e.g., swipe/touch) ‚Äî assume remote-only input.

## 2. üëÅÔ∏è Visual Clarity & Readability

- **Typography Requirements:**
  - Minimum **18sp for small text**, **24sp for body text**, **32sp for titles**
  - Use **medium or bold font weights** for better readability at distance
  - Prefer **sans-serif fonts** (Roboto, system fonts, or similar)
- **Color & Contrast:**
  - Use **dark backgrounds** (#000000 to #1a1a1a) with bright text/images
  - Maintain **4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum** for text
  - Use **brand colors** for primary actions and highlights
  - Avoid pure white text - use #FFFFFF or #F0F0F0 for better eye comfort
- **Safe Zones & Overscan:**
  - Keep **text within 90% of screen bounds** (5% margin)
  - Keep **interactive elements within 85% of screen bounds** (7.5% margin)
  - Use **10% general padding** for overall layout safety
  - Test on actual TV devices as overscan varies by manufacturer
- **Spacing & Layout:**
  - Use **minimum 16dp spacing** between focusable elements
  - **48dp minimum touch target size** for any interactive elements
  - Maintain **consistent grid systems** (8dp or 16dp base units)

---

## 3. üéÆ Input & Interaction

  - **Single press** for selection/activation
  - **Long press** for contextual menus or additional options
  - **Double press** sparingly and only for advanced features
- **Input Limitations:**
  - Avoid requiring **text input** unless absolutely necessary
  - When text input is needed, provide **voice input option** when available
  - Use **on-screen keyboards** with predictive text
- **Response Times:**
  - **Immediate feedback** (<100ms) for button presses
  - **Visual confirmation** for all user actions
  - **Loading states** for operations taking >200ms

---

## 4. üß± Layout & Structure

- **Content Organization:**
  - Use **horizontal scrolling rows** as primary content structure
  - **Hero banner** at top for featured content (16:9 aspect ratio recommended)
  - **Category rows** below hero with 6-8 items visible per row
  - **Vertical navigation** between rows, **horizontal within rows**
- **Layout Patterns:**
  - **Browse Fragment**: Main content discovery with rows of media
  - **Details Fragment**: Full-screen content details with actions
  - **Playback Fragment**: Video player with overlay controls
  - **Search Fragment**: Search interface with results
- **Information Architecture:**
  - **Hub-and-spoke navigation** - main menu leads to specialized views
  - **Maximum 3-level hierarchy** to prevent user confusion
  - **Breadcrumb navigation** for deep content structures
- **Content Loading:**
  - **Progressive loading** - show content as it becomes available
  - **Skeleton screens** during initial load
  - **Infinite scroll** for large catalogs with performance optimization
- **Grid Systems:**
  - Use **consistent spacing** (16dp, 24dp, 32dp multiples)
  - **Responsive grids** that adapt to different screen sizes
  - **Aspect ratios**: 16:9 for video, 2:3 for posters, 1:1 for profiles

---

## 5. üé® Motion & Feedback

- **Focus Animations:**
  - **Scale transform**: 1.0 to 1.1 scale on focus (100ms duration)
  - **Elevation/shadow**: Add depth with subtle shadows
  - **Color transitions**: Smooth border or background color changes
  - Use **ease-out timing** for natural feeling animations
- **Transition Guidelines:**
  - **Page transitions**: 300-400ms with slide or fade effects
  - **Focus transitions**: 100-150ms for immediate responsiveness
  - **Content loading**: Fade-in animations for new content (200ms)
- **Performance:**
  - **60fps target** for all animations
  - **Hardware acceleration** for transforms and opacity
  - **Reduce motion** option support for accessibility
- **Feedback Patterns:**
  - **Immediate visual feedback** on button press
  - **Audio feedback** for navigation (system sounds)
  - **Visual cues** for all user interactions
- **Loading States:**
  - **Shimmer effects** for content placeholders
  - **Progress indicators** for longer operations
  - **Skeleton screens** maintain layout during loading

  - **High contrast focus indicators** (minimum 3:1 contrast ratio)
  - **Focus order** follows logical reading pattern (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
  - **Focus trapping** in modals and overlays
  - **Skip navigation** options for long lists
- **Visual Accessibility:**
  - **Color independence** - don't rely solely on color for information

---

## 7. üìê Safe Zones

**Why Safe Zones Matter:** TVs can crop content around the edges due to overscan, where the TV displays an image larger than the screen to hide potential artifacts. This means content near screen edges may be cut off.

- **Safe Zone Requirements:**
  - **Title Safe Area**: Keep all text within **90% of screen bounds** (5% margin on all sides)
  - **Action Safe Area**: Keep interactive elements within **85% of screen bounds** (7.5% margin on all sides)
  - **General Content**: Use **10% padding minimum** from screen edges for optimal safety
  
- **Practical Implementation:**
  ```css
  /* Title safe - for text content */
  .title-safe {
    margin: 5vh 5vw; /* 5% margins */
  }
  
  /* Action safe - for buttons and interactive elements */
  .action-safe {
    margin: 7.5vh 7.5vw; /* 7.5% margins */
  }
  
  /* General safe zone - for overall layout */
  .safe-zone {
    padding: 10vh 10vw; /* 10% padding */
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
  ```

- **Overscan Considerations:**
  - **Modern TVs (2015+)**: Minimal overscan, but safe zones still recommended
  - **Older TVs**: May crop up to 10% on each edge
  - **Varies by manufacturer**: Samsung, LG, Sony handle overscan differently
  - **User settings**: Some users manually adjust overscan settings

- **Testing Strategy:**
  - Test on **real TV devices** when possible
  - Use **visual indicators** during development to verify safe zone compliance
  - Consider **dynamic safe zones** that adapt to detected screen capabilities

  - **4K**: 2160p (3840x2160) - newer devices
  - **HDR**: Support HDR10 and Dolby Vision where available
- **Responsive Design Principles:**
  - **Density-independent pixels** (dp/sp) for consistent sizing
  - **Flexible grid systems** that scale across resolutions
  - **Breakpoint-based layouts** for different screen sizes
  - **Vector graphics** (SVG) for crisp icons at any resolution
- **Platform Considerations:**
  - **Performance scaling** - 4K requires optimized assets and rendering
  - **Memory constraints** on lower-end devices
  - **Network bandwidth** considerations for different device tiers
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - **Real device testing** across TV device family
  - **Emulator testing** for initial development
  - **Performance profiling** on lowest-spec target devices

## üß† Development Tips

### Code Generation Guidelines
- **Component Naming**: Use TV patterns (`HeroBanner`, `BrowseRow`, `MediaCard`)
- **Focus Management**: Always implement proper focus handling with visual feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Support 720p, 1080p, and 4K resolutions
- **Performance**: Optimize for lowest-spec target devices first
- **Accessibility**: Include ARIA labels and screen reader support from the start

### Common Patterns
```javascript
// Focus handling example
const handleFocus = (element) => {
  element.style.transform = 'scale(1.1)';
  element.style.transition = 'transform 100ms ease-out';
};

// Safe zone implementation
const safeZoneStyle = {
  padding: '10vh 10vw', // 10% safe zones
  boxSizing: 'border-box'
};

// D-pad navigation
const handleKeyDown = (event) => {
  switch(event.key) {
    case 'ArrowUp': navigateUp(); break;
    case 'ArrowDown': navigateDown(); break;
    case 'ArrowLeft': navigateLeft(); break;
    case 'ArrowRight': navigateRight(); break;
    case 'Enter': selectItem(); break;
    case 'Escape': goBack(); break;
  }
};
```

### Testing Recommendations
- **Real Device Testing**: Test on actual TV devices, not just emulators
- **Performance Profiling**: Monitor memory usage and frame rates
- **Accessibility Testing**: Use screen readers and keyboard-only navigation
- **Network Testing**: Test with various connection speeds and offline scenarios
- **Cross-Resolution**: Verify layouts work across all supported resolutions
