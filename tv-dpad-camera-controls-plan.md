# TV D-pad Camera Controls Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of TV D-pad camera controls that will be displayed on the left side of the screen when the app is in TV mode. The feature includes directional arrow controls for camera rotation and a zoom control with dynamic text feedback.

## Feature Requirements

### 1. D-pad Arrow Controls
- **Display**: Show Up/Down/Left/Right arrow keys on the left side of the screen in TV mode
- **Positioning**: Left side, vertically centered
- **Functionality**: 
  - Up Arrow: Rotate camera view to North (0° longitude)
  - Right Arrow: Rotate camera view to East (90° longitude)
  - Down Arrow: Rotate camera view to South (180° longitude)
  - Left Arrow: Rotate camera view to West (270° longitude)

### 2. Zoom Control
- **Text Display**: "Hold SELECT to Zoom IN" / "Hold SELECT to Zoom OUT"
- **Control**: Enter key (SELECT button on TV remote)
- **Behavior**: 
  - Hold Enter: Zoom in to Earth
  - Release Enter: Text changes to "Hold SELECT to Zoom OUT"
  - Hold Enter again: Zoom out from Earth
  - Release Enter: Text returns to "Hold SELECT to Zoom IN"

### 3. Menu Integration
- **Back Button**: Escape key (Back button on TV remote)
- **Behavior**: Hide D-pad controls and reopen hamburger menu from left side

## Technical Implementation

### 1. New Component: TV D-pad Camera Controls

#### File: `src/components/Controls/TVDpadCameraControls.tsx`

```typescript
interface TVDpadCameraControlsProps {
  isVisible: boolean;
  onHide: () => void;
}

interface CameraDirection {
  longitude: number;
  latitude: number;
  distance: number;
}
```

#### Features:
- D-pad arrow buttons with proper TV styling
- Dynamic zoom text display
- Keyboard event handling for TV remote controls
- Smooth camera transitions
- Integration with existing camera system

### 2. Camera Control System Enhancement

#### Extend `src/components/Globe/Controls.tsx`

Add new props and functionality:
```typescript
interface ControlsProps {
  // ... existing props
  tvDpadMode?: boolean;
  targetDirection?: CameraDirection;
  zoomLevel?: number;
}
```

#### New Camera Functions:
- `rotateToDirection(direction: CameraDirection)`: Smooth rotation to cardinal directions
- `zoomToDistance(targetDistance: number)`: Smooth zoom in/out
- `resetToDefaultView()`: Return to default camera position

### 3. State Management

#### Extend `src/state/ISSContext.tsx`

Add new state properties:
```typescript
interface ISSState {
  // ... existing properties
  tvDpadMode: boolean;
  currentZoomLevel: number;
  targetDirection: CameraDirection | null;
}
```

Add new actions:
```typescript
type ISSAction =
  // ... existing actions
  | { type: 'SET_TV_DPAD_MODE'; payload: boolean }
  | { type: 'SET_TARGET_DIRECTION'; payload: CameraDirection | null }
  | { type: 'SET_ZOOM_LEVEL'; payload: number }
  | { type: 'RESET_CAMERA_VIEW' };
```

### 4. Keyboard Event Handling

#### Extend `src/hooks/useTVFocusManager.ts`

Add D-pad specific key handling:
```typescript
interface UseTVFocusManagerProps {
  // ... existing props
  onDpadDirection?: (direction: 'up' | 'down' | 'left' | 'right') => void;
  onSelectHold?: (isHolding: boolean) => void;
  onBackPress?: () => void;
}
```

#### Key Mappings:
- Arrow keys: Camera rotation
- Enter key: Zoom control (with hold detection)
- Escape key: Hide controls and show menu

### 5. Constants and Configuration

#### Add to `src/utils/constants.ts`

```typescript
// TV D-pad Camera Controls
export const TV_DPAD_CONFIG = {
  // Camera rotation settings
  ROTATION_SPEED: 0.05, // Radians per frame for smooth rotation
  ROTATION_TRANSITION_DURATION: 1000, // ms for smooth transitions
  
  // Zoom settings
  ZOOM_IN_DISTANCE: EARTH_RADIUS + 2, // Closest zoom level
  ZOOM_OUT_DISTANCE: CAMERA_DISTANCE * 2, // Farthest zoom level
  ZOOM_SPEED: 0.1, // Zoom speed multiplier
  
  // UI positioning
  LEFT_MARGIN: '20px',
  VERTICAL_CENTER: '50%',
  BUTTON_SIZE: '60px',
  BUTTON_SPACING: '20px'
};

// Cardinal direction coordinates
export const CARDINAL_DIRECTIONS = {
  NORTH: { longitude: 0, latitude: 0, distance: CAMERA_DISTANCE },
  EAST: { longitude: 90, latitude: 0, distance: CAMERA_DISTANCE },
  SOUTH: { longitude: 180, latitude: 0, distance: CAMERA_DISTANCE },
  WEST: { longitude: 270, latitude: 0, distance: CAMERA_DISTANCE }
};
```
