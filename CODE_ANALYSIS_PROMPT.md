# ReactJS Code Quality Assessment

## Scope
Analyze the following files/changes made after commit [COMMIT_HASH]:
[LIST_OF_FILES_OR_CHANGES]

## Assessment Criteria
Rate each dimension on a scale of 1-10 (10 = excellent, 1 = poor) with detailed justification.

### 1. Maintainability (Weight: 40%)
**Score: __/10**

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Code readability and structure
- TypeScript usage and type safety
- Component modularity and reusability
- Adherence to atomic design principles
- Proper separation of concerns (UI, business logic, services)
- Directory organization and file co-location
- Code complexity and cognitive load

**Justification:**
[Detailed explanation of score including specific examples from the code, architectural patterns followed/violated, component design quality, and maintainability concerns]

### 2. Performance (Weight: 35%)
**Score: __/10**

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Proper use of React optimization hooks (`React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`)
- Unnecessary re-renders and performance anti-patterns
- Bundle size impact and code splitting opportunities
- Efficient state management and updates
- Memory leaks and cleanup (useEffect dependencies, cleanup functions)
- Rendering performance (large lists, expensive calculations)
- Network performance (API calls, lazy loading)

**Justification:**
[Detailed analysis of performance implications, specific optimization opportunities missed or implemented well, potential bottlenecks, and measurable performance impact]

### 3. Test Coverage (Weight: 25%)
**Score: __/10**

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Presence and quality of unit tests
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Test completeness (happy paths, edge cases, error scenarios)
- Test maintainability and clarity
- Integration test coverage for critical flows
- Mocking strategies and test isolation
- Test documentation and setup

**Justification:**
[Assessment of test quality, coverage gaps, test design patterns, and how well tests support maintainability and refactoring confidence]

## Overall Quality Score
**Total: __/10** 
(Weighted calculation: (Maintainability × 0.4) + (Performance × 0.35) + (Test Coverage × 0.25))

## Detailed Analysis

### Strengths:
- [2-3 specific strengths with file:line references where applicable]

### Critical Issues:
- [High-impact problems that should be addressed immediately]

### Performance Concerns:
- [Specific performance implications and optimization opportunities]

### Maintainability Risks:
- [Code patterns that may cause future maintenance problems]

### Testing Gaps:
- [Missing test coverage or test quality issues]

## Actionable Recommendations
1. **High Priority:** [Most critical improvement with specific implementation guidance]
2. **Medium Priority:** [Important but less urgent improvement]
3. **Low Priority:** [Nice-to-have enhancement for future consideration]

## Code Examples
### Good Patterns Found:
```typescript
// Example of well-implemented pattern
```

### Areas for Improvement:
```typescript
// Example of pattern that needs refinement
```
