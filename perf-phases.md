# Performance Tier Implementation Phases

## Phase 1: Foundation âœ… COMPLETE

### Completed Tasks:
- âœ… Created PerformanceContext with tier state management
- âœ… Implemented PerformanceControls component with three-tier UI
- âœ… Defined tier-specific constants and settings
- âœ… Added PerformanceProvider to App.tsx
- âœ… Created PerformanceMonitor component for testing
- âœ… Integrated controls into Home page layout
- âœ… Added utility functions for tier settings

### Components Created:
- `src/state/PerformanceContext.tsx` - State management
- `src/components/Controls/PerformanceControls.tsx` - UI controls
- `src/components/Controls/PerformanceControls.css` - Styling
- `src/components/Controls/PerformanceMonitor.tsx` - Testing component
- `src/components/Controls/PerformanceMonitor.css` - Monitor styling
- `src/utils/performanceTiers.ts` - Utility functions

### Current Status:
- Performance tier system is live and functional
- Users can switch between High/Medium/Low tiers
- Settings are properly managed in global state
- UI provides real-time feedback for tier changes

## Phase 2: Component Adaptation ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

### Tasks:
- [ ] Modify Earth.tsx for tier-based rendering
- [ ] Adapt ISS-Enhanced.tsx for dynamic trail settings
- [ ] Update Globe.tsx for conditional component rendering
- [ ] Implement Sun.tsx tier support
- [ ] Add conditional shader/material loading
- [ ] Implement dynamic geometry creation

### Components to Modify:
- `src/components/Globe/Earth.tsx`
- `src/components/Globe/ISS-Enhanced.tsx`
- `src/components/Globe/Globe.tsx`
- `src/components/Globe/Sun.tsx`

---

## Phase 3: Optimization ðŸ”„ PENDING

### Tasks:
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Implement smooth tier transitions
- [ ] Add tier-specific loading states
- [ ] Optimize texture loading per tier
- [ ] Add memory management
- [ ] Implement FPS monitoring

---

## Phase 4: Testing & Refinement ðŸ”„ PENDING

### Tasks:
- [ ] Test on various devices
- [ ] Measure performance impact
- [ ] Fine-tune tier settings
- [ ] Add user feedback mechanisms
- [ ] Validate WebGL resource management
- [ ] Test memory usage patterns

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Performance Tier Settings:
- **High**: Full effects, 60fps, 5s updates, shadows enabled
- **Medium**: Balanced effects, 30fps, 10s updates, no shadows
- **Low**: Basic effects, 15fps, 30s updates, minimal features

### Architecture Decisions:
- Separate PerformanceContext from ISSContext
- Preload all textures with different quality versions
- Compile all shader variants upfront
- Use single geometry with LOD for trails
- Conservative memory management approach

### Next Steps:
1. Begin Phase 2 by examining current component implementations
2. Identify specific areas for tier-based optimization
3. Implement conditional rendering based on performance settings
4. Test each component with different tier settings
