# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing ISS tracking application with a dedicated TV interface mode that provides an optimized user experience for television displays. The TV mode will be automatically activated when the device width is exactly 1920px, providing larger fonts, a persistent full-height navigation menu, keyboard navigation support, and responsive menu behavior based on user interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a TV user, I want the application to automatically detect when I'm using a TV display, so that the interface adapts appropriately for 10-foot viewing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device width is exactly 1920px THEN the system SHALL activate TV profile mode
2. WHEN TV profile is activated THEN the system SHALL apply TV-specific styling and behavior
3. WHEN the device width changes from 1920px THEN the system SHALL deactivate TV profile mode
4. WHEN TV profile is active THEN the system SHALL persist this state throughout the user session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a TV user, I want text and UI elements to be appropriately sized for viewing from a distance, so that I can comfortably read and interact with the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TV profile is enabled THEN the system SHALL increase font sizes for optimal 10-foot viewing
2. WHEN TV profile is enabled THEN the system SHALL apply TV-safe zone margins (5% padding from screen edges)
3. WHEN TV profile is enabled THEN the system SHALL ensure high contrast between text and background
4. WHEN TV profile is enabled THEN the system SHALL maintain adequate spacing between interactive elements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a TV user, I want a persistent navigation menu that's always visible and accessible, so that I can easily access controls without having to remember how to open a hidden menu.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TV profile is enabled THEN the HamburgerMenu SHALL be displayed as a full-height sidebar on the left side of the screen
2. WHEN TV profile is enabled THEN the HamburgerMenu SHALL be visible by default without requiring user interaction
3. WHEN TV profile is enabled THEN the HamburgerMenu SHALL maintain its position throughout user interactions
4. WHEN TV profile is enabled THEN the main content area SHALL adjust to accommodate the persistent menu

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a TV user, I want to navigate the menu using arrow keys and remote control buttons, so that I can interact with the interface without requiring a mouse or touch input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TV profile is enabled THEN the HamburgerMenu buttons SHALL support keyboard navigation via arrow keys
2. WHEN a user presses the up/down arrow keys THEN the focus SHALL move to the previous/next focusable button in the menu
3. WHEN a button receives focus THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback (border, scaling, or highlighting)
4. WHEN a user presses Enter or Space on a focused button THEN the system SHALL activate that button's functionality
5. WHEN focus reaches the first button and up arrow is pressed THEN focus SHALL loop to the last button
6. WHEN focus reaches the last button and down arrow is pressed THEN focus SHALL loop to the first button

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a TV user, I want the navigation menu to automatically close when I select manual camera mode, so that I have an unobstructed view for manual camera control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "Manual" button in ISSFollowControls THEN the HamburgerMenu SHALL close by animating to the left off-screen
2. WHEN the HamburgerMenu closes THEN the animation SHALL be smooth and take approximately 300ms
3. WHEN the HamburgerMenu is closed THEN the main content area SHALL expand to fill the available space
4. WHEN the HamburgerMenu closes THEN the system SHALL maintain the manual mode state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a TV user, I want to reopen the navigation menu using the back button or escape key when it's closed, so that I can access controls again when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the HamburgerMenu is closed AND the user presses the "back" button THEN the menu SHALL reopen by sliding in from the left
2. WHEN the HamburgerMenu is closed AND the user presses the "Esc" key THEN the menu SHALL reopen by sliding in from the left
3. WHEN the HamburgerMenu reopens THEN the animation SHALL be smooth and take approximately 300ms
4. WHEN the HamburgerMenu reopens THEN the main content area SHALL adjust to accommodate the menu
5. WHEN the HamburgerMenu reopens THEN the focus SHALL return to the first focusable button in the menu
