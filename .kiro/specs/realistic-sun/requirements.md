# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to transform the current basic sun visualization into a highly realistic solar representation that accurately depicts the sun's visual characteristics, surface features, and dynamic solar phenomena. The enhanced sun will provide users with an immersive and scientifically accurate view of our solar system's central star, complete with animated surface activity, realistic corona effects, and proper lighting interactions with the Earth.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the solar system visualization, I want to see a realistic sun with visible surface texture and features, so that I can appreciate the sun's actual appearance and understand its physical characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sun is rendered THEN the system SHALL display a textured surface with solar activity patterns visible at normal viewing distances
2. WHEN the sun is visible THEN the system SHALL show subtle surface variations and solar features appropriate for the viewing scale
3. WHEN viewing the sun THEN the system SHALL display realistic solar surface coloration with a bright core and natural color gradients
4. WHEN the sun is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain visual quality optimized for typical solar system viewing distances

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user observing the sun, I want to see dynamic solar activity like solar flares and prominences, so that I can witness the sun's active and energetic nature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sun is active THEN the system SHALL display animated solar flares that extend from the surface
2. WHEN solar activity occurs THEN the system SHALL show prominences arcing from the sun's surface
3. WHEN flares are active THEN the system SHALL animate particle emissions with realistic motion patterns
4. WHEN solar activity changes THEN the system SHALL vary the intensity and frequency of flares over time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing the solar system, I want to see a realistic corona around the sun, so that I can observe the sun's extended atmosphere and its dynamic behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sun is rendered THEN the system SHALL display a multi-layered corona with varying opacity and color
2. WHEN the corona is visible THEN the system SHALL show streaming plasma effects extending outward
3. WHEN solar wind occurs THEN the system SHALL animate particle streams flowing from the corona
4. IF the viewing angle changes THEN the system SHALL maintain corona visibility and realistic appearance from all angles

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user experiencing the visualization, I want the sun to emit realistic lighting that affects the Earth and other objects, so that I can see accurate illumination and shadow effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sun is present THEN the system SHALL emit directional light that illuminates the Earth realistically
2. WHEN Earth rotates THEN the system SHALL create accurate day/night terminator lines based on sun position
3. WHEN objects are between the sun and Earth THEN the system SHALL cast realistic shadows
4. WHEN the sun's intensity varies THEN the system SHALL adjust the lighting intensity accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the visualization, I want the sun's appearance to look realistic from the typical viewing distances in the solar system, so that I can appreciate its beauty without unnecessary detail complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the sun at normal solar system distances THEN the system SHALL display an appropriately sized sun with visible corona and surface glow
2. WHEN the viewing angle changes THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent visual quality and realistic appearance
3. WHEN the sun is in view THEN the system SHALL show subtle limb darkening effects that enhance realism
4. WHEN observing the sun THEN the system SHALL provide visual detail appropriate for the scale of the solar system visualization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want the realistic sun to maintain good performance, so that the visualization remains smooth and responsive during interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the realistic sun is active THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 30 FPS during normal operation
2. WHEN multiple solar effects are running THEN the system SHALL optimize rendering to prevent performance degradation
3. WHEN the user interacts with controls THEN the system SHALL respond without noticeable lag
4. IF performance drops THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust effect quality to maintain smooth operation
