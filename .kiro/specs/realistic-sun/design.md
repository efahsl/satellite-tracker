# Realistic Sun Design Document

## Overview

This design transforms the current basic sun visualization into a realistic solar representation using advanced Three.js techniques. The enhanced sun will feature dynamic surface textures, animated solar phenomena, realistic corona effects, and proper lighting integration while maintaining optimal performance for the solar system visualization scale.

The design leverages shader materials, particle systems, and layered rendering techniques to create convincing solar effects that are visible and impactful at typical viewing distances without requiring extreme detail levels.
