# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds directional camera navigation controls and zoom functionality specifically for TV mode in the ISS tracking application. When the application is in TV mode, users will have access to visual directional arrow controls (Up/Down/Left/Right) positioned on the left side of the screen for rotating the Earth camera view, along with dynamic zoom controls using the SELECT button (Enter key). The controls will integrate with the existing TV interface and hide when the back button is pressed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a TV user, I want to see directional arrow controls on the left side of the screen, so that I can understand how to navigate the camera view of the Earth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TV profile is enabled AND the hamburger menu is closed THEN the system SHALL display directional arrow controls on the left side of the screen
2. WHEN the directional controls are displayed THEN they SHALL show Up, Down, Left, and Right arrow buttons in a circular or cross pattern
3. WHEN the directional controls are displayed THEN they SHALL be positioned to not interfere with the main Earth view
4. WHEN the hamburger menu is open THEN the directional controls SHALL be hidden
5. WHEN the user is not in TV mode THEN the directional controls SHALL not be displayed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a TV user, I want to rotate the camera view when I press the different d-pad arrows, so that I can navigate to different regions of the Earth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NOT in zoom mode AND the user presses the Up arrow key THEN the camera SHALL rotate the Earth view toward the north
2. WHEN NOT in zoom mode AND the user presses the Down arrow key THEN the camera SHALL rotate the Earth view toward the south
3. WHEN NOT in zoom mode AND the user presses the Right arrow key THEN the camera SHALL rotate the Earth view toward the east
4. WHEN NOT in zoom mode AND the user presses the Left arrow key THEN the camera SHALL rotate the Earth view toward the west
5. WHEN directional navigation is active AND NOT in zoom mode THEN the camera rotation SHALL be smooth and responsive
6. WHEN NOT in zoom mode AND the user holds down an arrow key THEN the camera SHALL continue rotating in that direction

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a TV user, I want to enter a zoom mode by pressing SELECT and then use Up/Down arrows to zoom in and out, so that I can precisely control the zoom level of the Earth view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the directional controls are visible THEN the system SHALL display "Press SELECT for Zoom Mode" text
2. WHEN the user presses the Enter key (SELECT) THEN the system SHALL enter zoom mode
3. WHEN in zoom mode THEN the system SHALL display "UP: Zoom In, DOWN: Zoom Out, SELECT: Exit" text
4. WHEN in zoom mode AND the user presses the Up arrow THEN the camera SHALL zoom in toward the Earth
5. WHEN in zoom mode AND the user presses the Down arrow THEN the camera SHALL zoom out from the Earth
6. WHEN in zoom mode THEN the Left and Right arrow keys SHALL be disabled and not respond
7. WHEN in zoom mode AND the user presses SELECT again THEN the system SHALL exit zoom mode
8. WHEN exiting zoom mode THEN the text SHALL return to "Press SELECT for Zoom Mode" and all directional arrows SHALL be re-enabled

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a TV user, I want the directional controls to disappear when I press the back button, so that I can access the main menu without the controls blocking my view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the directional controls are visible AND the user presses the Escape key (back button) THEN the controls SHALL hide
2. WHEN the directional controls hide THEN the hamburger menu SHALL open from the left side
3. WHEN the hamburger menu is open THEN the directional controls SHALL remain hidden
4. WHEN the user closes the hamburger menu again THEN the directional controls SHALL reappear
5. WHEN transitioning between menu and controls THEN the animations SHALL be smooth and coordinated

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a TV user, I want the camera navigation controls to only work when I'm in manual camera mode, so that they don't interfere with ISS tracking when I want to follow the ISS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is in ISS follow mode THEN the directional navigation controls SHALL be disabled or hidden
2. WHEN the user switches to manual camera mode THEN the directional navigation controls SHALL become active and responsive
3. WHEN the user is in manual camera mode AND uses directional navigation THEN the camera SHALL respond to the directional inputs
4. WHEN the user is in manual camera mode AND uses zoom controls THEN the camera SHALL zoom in and out as expected
5. WHEN the user switches from manual mode back to ISS follow mode THEN the directional controls SHALL be disabled ing the mode setting
