# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds directional camera navigation controls and zoom functionality specifically for TV mode in the ISS tracking application. When the application is in TV mode, users will have access to visual directional arrow controls (Up/Down/Left/Right) positioned on the left side of the screen for rotating the Earth camera view, along with dynamic zoom controls using the SELECT button (Enter key). The controls will integrate with the existing TV interface and hide when the back button is pressed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a TV user, I want to see directional arrow controls on the left side of the screen, so that I can understand how to navigate the camera view of the Earth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TV profile is enabled AND the hamburger menu is closed THEN the system SHALL display directional arrow controls on the left side of the screen
2. WHEN the directional controls are displayed THEN they SHALL show Up, Down, Left, and Right arrow buttons in a circular or cross pattern
3. WHEN the directional controls are displayed THEN they SHALL be positioned to not interfere with the main Earth view
4. WHEN the hamburger menu is open THEN the directional controls SHALL be hidden
5. WHEN the user is not in TV mode THEN the directional controls SHALL not be displayed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a TV user, I want to rotate the camera view to the north when I press the up arrow, so that I can navigate to different regions of the Earth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses the Up arrow key THEN the camera SHALL rotate the Earth view toward the north
2. WHEN the user presses the Down arrow key THEN the camera SHALL rotate the Earth view toward the south
3. WHEN the user presses the Right arrow key THEN the camera SHALL rotate the Earth view toward the east
4. WHEN the user presses the Left arrow key THEN the camera SHALL rotate the Earth view toward the west
5. WHEN directional navigation is active THEN the camera rotation SHALL be smooth and responsive
6. WHEN the user holds down an arrow key THEN the camera SHALL continue rotating in that direction

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a TV user, I want to zoom into the Earth view by holding the SELECT button, so that I can get a closer look at specific regions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the directional controls are visible THEN the system SHALL display "Hold SELECT to Zoom IN" text
2. WHEN the user presses and holds the Enter key (SELECT) THEN the camera SHALL zoom in toward the Earth
3. WHEN the user is holding SELECT and zooming in THEN the text SHALL change to "Hold SELECT to Zoom OUT"
4. WHEN the user releases the Enter key after zooming in THEN the zoom action SHALL stop
5. WHEN the user presses and holds Enter again after zooming in THEN the camera SHALL zoom out
6. WHEN the user releases Enter after zooming out THEN the text SHALL return to "Hold SELECT to Zoom IN"

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a TV user, I want the directional controls to disappear when I press the back button, so that I can access the main menu without the controls blocking my view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the directional controls are visible AND the user presses the Escape key (back button) THEN the controls SHALL hide
2. WHEN the directional controls hide THEN the hamburger menu SHALL open from the left side
3. WHEN the hamburger menu is open THEN the directional controls SHALL remain hidden
4. WHEN the user closes the hamburger menu again THEN the directional controls SHALL reappear
5. WHEN transitioning between menu and controls THEN the animations SHALL be smooth and coordinated

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a TV user, I want the camera navigation to work independently of the ISS tracking mode, so that I can explore the Earth regardless of whether I'm following the ISS or in manual mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is in ISS follow mode AND uses directional navigation THEN the camera SHALL move independently of ISS tracking
2. WHEN the user switches back to ISS follow mode THEN the camera SHALL resume following the ISS position
3. WHEN the user is in manual camera mode AND uses directional navigation THEN the camera SHALL respond to the directional inputs
4. WHEN using zoom controls THEN the zoom level SHALL be maintained when switching between ISS follow and manual modes
5. WHEN directional navigation is used THEN it SHALL temporarily override ISS follow mode without permanently changing the mode setting
