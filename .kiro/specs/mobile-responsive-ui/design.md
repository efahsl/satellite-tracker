# Design Document

## Overview

The mobile responsive UI feature will transform the ISS Live Tracker from a desktop-only application into a multi-device experience. The design introduces a device detection system that adapts the interface based on screen size and device capabilities, while maintaining the existing desktop experience unchanged.

The core principle is progressive enhancement - the desktop experience remains identical while mobile devices receive an optimized interface that addresses the constraints of smaller screens and touch interaction.

## Architecture

### Device Detection System

Following the project's React Context pattern for global state management, the system will use a React Context + Reducer pattern combined with Bootstrap CSS responsive utilities:

```typescript
enum DeviceType {
  MOBILE = 'mobile',
  DESKTOP = 'desktop', 
  TV = 'tv'
}

interface DeviceState {
  deviceType: DeviceType;
  screenWidth: number;
  screenHeight: number;
  isTouchDevice: boolean;
}

interface DeviceContextType {
  state: DeviceState;
  dispatch: React.Dispatch<DeviceAction>;
}
```

**Detection Logic:**
- Mobile: Screen width < 768px (Bootstrap's md breakpoint) OR touch-only device
- Desktop: Screen width >= 768px AND < 1920px with mouse/keyboard
- TV: Screen width >= 1920px (future implementation)

### Responsive Strategy

The design follows the project architecture guidelines by using:

1. **React Context Pattern**: Device detection state managed via React Context + Reducer
2. **Custom CSS Utilities**: Extend the existing custom utility class system with responsive variants
3. **Component Composition**: Use conditional rendering within existing components rather than creating entirely separate variants
4. **TypeScript Interfaces**: Proper typing for all device-related data structures

This approach aligns with the project's current custom CSS utility system (similar to Tailwind) and React Context state management pattern.

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Device Context Provider

Following the project's React Context + Reducer pattern:

```typescript
interface DeviceState {
  deviceType: DeviceType;
  screenWidth: number;
  screenHeight: number;
  isTouchDevice: boolean;
}

type DeviceAction = 
  | { type: 'SET_DEVICE_TYPE'; payload: DeviceType }
  | { type: 'UPDATE_SCREEN_SIZE'; payload: { width: number; height: number } }
  | { type: 'SET_TOUCH_DEVICE'; payload: boolean };

interface DeviceContextType {
  state: DeviceState;
  dispatch: React.Dispatch<DeviceAction>;
  // Computed properties for convenience
  isMobile: boolean;
  isDesktop: boolean;
  isTV: boolean;
}

const DeviceContext = React.createContext<DeviceContextType>();
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Manage device detection state using useReducer
- Detect device type on mount and window resize
- Provide device context to all child components
- Handle orientation changes on mobile devices
- Follow project's state management patterns

### 2. Responsive FPS Monitor

The FPS Monitor will have two display modes:

**Desktop Mode (unchanged):**
- Shows FPS, Avg, Min, Max values
- Full performance graph
- Current positioning and styling

**Mobile Mode:**
- Shows only current FPS value and graph
- Removes Avg, Min, Max statistics
- Maintains color-coded performance indicators
- Optimized size for mobile screens

```typescript
interface FPSMonitorProps {
  deviceType: DeviceType;
  // ... existing props
}
```

### 3. Responsive Info Panel Layout

The InfoPanel system will adapt its internal layout based on device type:

**Desktop Mode (unchanged):**
- Coordinates and Altitude components stacked vertically
- Current font sizes and spacing
- Existing FloatingInfoPanel positioning

**Mobile Mode:**
- Coordinates and Altitude displayed side-by-side
- Reduced font sizes for better fit
- Optimized spacing and padding
- Maintained readability and accessibility

### 4. Layout Adaptation System

Using the existing custom utility class system with responsive extensions:

```typescript
interface ResponsiveLayoutProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

const ResponsiveLayout: React.FC<ResponsiveLayoutProps> = ({ children }) => {
  const { isMobile, isDesktop } = useDevice();
  
  return (
    <div className={`
      ${isMobile ? 'block md:hidden' : ''}
      ${isDesktop ? 'hidden md:block' : ''}
    `}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};
```

This approach extends the existing custom utility class system with responsive variants (similar to Tailwind's approach), maintaining consistency with the current CSS architecture.

## Data Models

### Device Detection Model

```typescript
interface DeviceDetectionResult {
  deviceType: DeviceType;
  screenWidth: number;
  screenHeight: number;
  pixelRatio: number;
  isTouchDevice: boolean;
  userAgent: string;
  orientation?: 'portrait' | 'landscape';
}
```

### Responsive Configuration Model

Using the existing breakpoint system and TypeScript interfaces:

```typescript
interface ResponsiveConfig {
  breakpoints: {
    mobile: 768; // Matches existing @media (min-width: 768px) breakpoint
    desktop: 768;
    tv: 1920;
  };
  components: {
    fpsMonitor: {
      mobile: Partial<FPSMonitorProps>;
      desktop: Partial<FPSMonitorProps>;
    };
    infoPanel: {
      mobile: {
        layout: 'horizontal';
        fontSize: 'text-xs';
      };
      desktop: {
        layout: 'vertical';
        fontSize: 'text-sm';
      };
    };
  };
}
```

## Error Handling

### Device Detection Failures

- **Fallback Strategy**: Default to desktop mode if detection fails
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure core functionality works regardless of detection accuracy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Mobile optimizations are enhancements, not requirements

### Layout Rendering Issues

- **CSS Fallbacks**: Provide fallback styles for unsupported features
- **Component Error Boundaries**: Isolate responsive component failures
- **State Recovery**: Maintain application state during device type changes

### Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Load device-specific assets only when needed
- **Debounced Resize**: Prevent excessive re-renders during window resize
- **Memory Management**: Clean up event listeners and observers

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

Following the project's Jest + React Testing Library approach:

1. **Device Detection Logic**
   - Test device reducer with various actions
   - Test device detection hook with different screen sizes
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions using Jest

2. **Component Rendering**
   - Use React Testing Library to test component rendering for each device type
   - Test context provider and consumer integration
   - Test component behavior during device type changes

3. **Responsive Utilities**
   - Test custom hooks with different device contexts
   - Test CSS class application logic with existing utility classes
   - Test utility functions for different device types

### Integration Testing

1. **Device Context Integration**
   - Test context provider with various device scenarios
   - Verify context updates propagate to child components
   - Test context behavior during orientation changes

2. **Layout Adaptation**
   - Test complete layout rendering for each device type
   - Verify no regressions in desktop mode
   - Test smooth transitions between device types

3. **Component Interaction**
   - Test FPS Monitor behavior across device types
   - Test InfoPanel layout changes
   - Verify touch interactions work on mobile

### Visual Regression Testing

1. **Screenshot Comparisons**
   - Capture screenshots for each device type
   - Compare against baseline images
   - Detect unintended visual changes

2. **Cross-Device Testing**
   - Test on actual mobile devices
   - Verify touch interactions
   - Test various screen sizes and orientations

### Performance Testing

1. **Rendering Performance**
   - Measure component render times for each device type
   - Test memory usage during device type switches
   - Verify no performance regressions on desktop

2. **Bundle Size Impact**
   - Measure JavaScript bundle size increase
   - Verify code splitting works correctly
   - Test loading performance on mobile networks
