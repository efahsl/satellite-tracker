# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the ISS Live Tracker application to support multiple device types with optimized user experiences. The application currently works well on desktop but needs significant improvements for mobile devices. The feature will introduce a responsive design system that adapts the interface based on device type, with specific optimizations for mobile phones while maintaining the existing desktop experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the application to detect my device type and provide an optimized interface, so that I can easily view ISS tracking information on my phone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL detect the device type (mobile, desktop, or TV)
2. WHEN a mobile device is detected THEN the system SHALL apply mobile-specific layout and styling
3. WHEN a desktop device is detected THEN the system SHALL maintain the current desktop layout
4. IF the device type changes (e.g., rotation, window resize) THEN the system SHALL update the interface accordingly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want a simplified FPS monitor that shows only essential information, so that it doesn't clutter my small screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the FPS monitor SHALL display only the current FPS value and performance graph
2. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the FPS monitor SHALL NOT display average, minimum, or maximum values
3. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the FPS monitor SHALL maintain its current full display with all metrics
4. WHEN the FPS monitor is displayed THEN it SHALL remain readable and accessible on the mobile screen

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the ISS position information to be displayed efficiently in a compact layout, so that I can see all relevant data without excessive scrolling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the Coordinates and Altitude components SHALL be displayed side-by-side
2. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the font size SHALL be optimized to fit the available screen width
3. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the FloatingInfoPanel SHALL maintain its current stacked layout
4. WHEN the FloatingInfoPanel is displayed THEN all information SHALL remain clearly readable and accessible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a flexible device detection system that can support future device types, so that adding TV support later will be straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing device detection THEN the system SHALL support three device types: mobile, desktop, and TV
2. WHEN detecting device type THEN the system SHALL use a combination of screen size and user agent detection
3. WHEN adding new device types THEN the system SHALL allow easy extension without breaking existing functionality
4. IF TV support is added later THEN the system SHALL be able to handle 1920x1080px displays as a separate category

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the application to maintain its core functionality while adapting to my screen size, so that I can track the ISS effectively regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application on any device THEN all core ISS tracking features SHALL remain functional
2. WHEN the interface adapts to different screen sizes THEN the 3D globe and ISS visualization SHALL remain interactive
3. WHEN switching between device layouts THEN the application state SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN using touch devices THEN the controls SHALL be optimized for touch interaction

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a desktop user, I want the application interface to remain unchanged from the current version, so that my familiar workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the UI SHALL maintain the exact same layout as the current implementation
2. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN all component positioning and sizing SHALL remain identical to the existing design
3. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN no visual changes SHALL be introduced that alter the current user experience
4. WHEN implementing responsive features THEN desktop functionality SHALL be preserved without any regressions
