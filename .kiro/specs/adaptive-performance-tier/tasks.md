# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Enhance FPSMonitor with data export and create adaptive performance hook

  - Add `onFPSUpdate` callback prop to FPSMonitor component for data export
  - Create `src/hooks/useAdaptivePerformance.ts` with FPS analysis logic
  - Implement 5-second rolling window analysis with 15 FPS lower and 55 FPS upper thresholds
  - Add cooldown period (10 seconds) and manual override (30 seconds) management
  - Include error handling for invalid FPS data and insufficient data scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 2. Implement tier adjustment logic with PerformanceContext integration

  - Add `analyzeFPSData` function with variance checking and stability requirements
  - Implement tier change execution using existing `setTier` method
  - Add boundary checking to prevent adjusting beyond min/max tiers
  - Include single-tier-level adjustment constraint and hysteresis logic
  - Add manual override detection and state synchronization
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 3. Integrate adaptive performance system with Globe component
  - Connect useAdaptivePerformance hook to Globe component
  - Wire FPSMonitor data export to adaptive performance system
  - Add proper cleanup and error handling for component lifecycle
  - Include basic logging for tier adjustment decisions
  - Ensure backward compatibility with existing FPSMonitor usage
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_
