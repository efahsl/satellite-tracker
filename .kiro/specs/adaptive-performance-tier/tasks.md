# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create adaptive performance hook with FPS analysis logic
  - Create `src/hooks/useAdaptivePerformance.ts` with core monitoring functionality
  - Implement 5-second rolling window for FPS data collection
  - Add FPS analysis logic with 30 FPS threshold for tier reduction
  - Include cooldown period (10 seconds) to prevent rapid adjustments
  - Add tier boundary checking to stop monitoring at lowest tier
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 2. Enhance FPSMonitor component with data export capability
  - Add optional `onFPSUpdate` callback prop to FPSMonitor component
  - Integrate callback into existing FPS measurement cycle
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing FPSMonitor usage
  - Test data export functionality without affecting display
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3, 3.2_

- [ ] 3. Integrate adaptive performance system with Globe component
  - Connect useAdaptivePerformance hook to Globe component
  - Wire FPSMonitor callback to adaptive performance system
  - Add proper cleanup and error handling for component lifecycle
  - Test complete integration flow with tier adjustments
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4, 3.2, 3.4_
