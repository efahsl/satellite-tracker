# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements automatic performance tier adjustment based on real-time FPS monitoring. The system will analyze the previous 5 seconds of FPS data to determine whether the current performance tier should be lowered (to improve performance) or raised (to enhance visual quality) automatically, providing users with the optimal balance between visual fidelity and smooth performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with varying system performance, I want the app to automatically adjust visual quality based on my device's current performance, so that I always get the smoothest possible experience without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects consistently low FPS over 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL automatically lower the performance tier
2. WHEN the system detects consistently high FPS over 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL automatically raise the performance tier
3. WHEN the performance tier changes automatically THEN the system SHALL apply the new settings immediately to the 3D globe rendering
4. WHEN the performance tier reaches the minimum level THEN the system SHALL NOT attempt to lower it further
5. WHEN the performance tier reaches the maximum level THEN the system SHALL NOT attempt to raise it further

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the automatic performance adjustment to be based on meaningful FPS data, so that the system doesn't make unnecessary changes due to temporary performance spikes or drops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collecting FPS data THEN the system SHALL maintain a rolling 5-second window of FPS measurements
2. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL use the average FPS over the 5-second window for decision making
3. WHEN FPS data is insufficient (less than 5 seconds) THEN the system SHALL NOT make automatic tier adjustments
4. WHEN the FPS variance is high within the 5-second window THEN the system SHALL prioritize stability over optimization
5. WHEN the system starts up THEN the system SHALL wait for at least 5 seconds of data before making any automatic adjustments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear thresholds for performance tier changes, so that the system behaves predictably and doesn't constantly switch between tiers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN average FPS drops below 15 FPS over 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL lower the performance tier by one level
2. WHEN average FPS exceeds 55 FPS over 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL raise the performance tier by one level
3. WHEN average FPS is between 15-55 FPS THEN the system SHALL maintain the current performance tier
4. WHEN a tier change occurs THEN the system SHALL wait at least 10 seconds before making another automatic adjustment
5. WHEN multiple tier changes would be needed THEN the system SHALL only change by one tier level at a time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the automatic performance adjustment to work seamlessly with existing performance controls, so that I can still manually override the system when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user manually changes the performance tier THEN the system SHALL respect the manual setting and disable automatic adjustment for 30 seconds
2. WHEN the manual override period expires THEN the system SHALL resume automatic performance monitoring and adjustment
3. WHEN automatic adjustment is disabled THEN the system SHALL continue collecting FPS data for future use
4. WHEN the user enables/disables performance monitoring THEN the automatic tier adjustment SHALL be enabled/disabled accordingly
5. WHEN the system makes an automatic adjustment THEN the UI SHALL reflect the new performance tier setting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the automatic performance system to integrate cleanly with existing performance monitoring, so that it doesn't interfere with current functionality or create performance overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the FPS monitor is already running THEN the automatic tier system SHALL reuse existing FPS data collection
2. WHEN the performance context updates THEN the automatic tier system SHALL receive the updated performance tier information
3. WHEN the automatic system changes tiers THEN it SHALL use the existing performance tier change mechanisms
4. WHEN the system is under heavy load THEN the automatic adjustment logic SHALL have minimal performance impact
5. WHEN the Globe component unmounts THEN the automatic tier adjustment SHALL be properly cleaned up
