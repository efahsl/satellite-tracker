# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds an "Earth Rotate" camera mode to the existing ISSFollowControls component. When activated, the camera will position itself at the Earth's equator and automatically rotate around the Earth, simulating the planet's natural rotation with a complete revolution every 30 seconds. This provides users with a cinematic view of Earth spinning from a fixed orbital perspective.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the Earth visualization, I want to activate an "Earth Rotate" camera mode, so that I can watch the Earth spin from an equatorial orbital perspective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "Earth Rotate" button THEN the system SHALL position the camera at the Earth's equator
2. WHEN the "Earth Rotate" mode is active THEN the system SHALL automatically rotate the camera around Earth's axis
3. WHEN the camera is rotating THEN the system SHALL complete one full revolution in approximately 30 seconds
4. WHEN the "Earth Rotate" mode is activated THEN the system SHALL disable other camera control modes
5. WHEN the user selects a different camera mode THEN the system SHALL stop the Earth rotation animation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the "Earth Rotate" button to be visually integrated with existing controls, so that the interface remains consistent and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display the "Earth Rotate" button alongside existing camera control buttons
2. WHEN the "Earth Rotate" mode is active THEN the system SHALL highlight the button using the same blue color as selected buttons in the PerformanceControls component
3. WHEN the "Earth Rotate" mode is inactive THEN the system SHALL display the button in its default state
4. WHEN the user hovers over the button THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback consistent with other controls

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth camera transitions when entering and exiting "Earth Rotate" mode, so that the experience feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user activates "Earth Rotate" mode THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition the camera from its current position to the equatorial view
2. WHEN the user deactivates "Earth Rotate" mode THEN the system SHALL smoothly stop the rotation animation
3. WHEN transitioning between modes THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent frame rates without jarring movements
4. WHEN the rotation is active THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth, consistent rotation speed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Earth rotation to follow realistic physics, so that the visualization feels authentic and educational.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Earth rotates THEN the system SHALL rotate in the correct direction (west to east when viewed from above the North Pole)
2. WHEN the camera is positioned THEN the system SHALL maintain an appropriate distance from Earth's surface for optimal viewing
3. WHEN the rotation occurs THEN the system SHALL keep the Earth centered in the camera view
4. WHEN the rotation speed is set THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent angular velocity throughout the animation
